So a couple of these can be looked at and immedietly we can figure them out. 'date' for instance can be cast back into a date time data type. A bunch of these are most likely catagorical variables. which basically means that the data is limited to a finite number of categories like 'Location_Discription' for instance likely only has about 10 diffrent inputs. There are special ways to deal with this so that we can do further analysis, lets check on this one first. Here we are going to use the 'dot notation method' to grab the column(it just means you put the call like this(df.column)) and then add a chained method to get unique values on the column. first we will call df.column.unique() we can also wrap that into a len statement to see how many cats we are dealing with.\n",
